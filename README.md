[![No Maintenance Intended](http://unmaintained.tech/badge.svg)](http://unmaintained.tech/)

In an effort to reduce the number of packages we publicly maintain, Sprout Reports Categories will not be migrated to Craft 4. Upgrade to Craft 4 to build custom category reports using [Sprout Data Studio](https://plugins.craftcms.com/sprout-data-studio). Use the Custom Query or Twig Query Data Source to design the data sets you need.
